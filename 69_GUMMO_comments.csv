I’m just imagining 50 year old white women listening to this in court
The biggest flex was hearing this song as soon as it came out.
"2:14 ""Damn, forgot my mask"""
Who like 6ix9ine old style??
He made this song when he found out that he is 1% black
when ancestry says you’re 0.0001 percent black.
No joke man even though we hate him this song still is hard af
Yall cant even lie this song was turnt af when we first heard it 🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
imagine walking home from school and seeing them make this
There is a reason why the lyrics aren't in the description
Hands down the best skittle commercial
You can’t lie even if we hate 6ix9ine this song still hits
"2:15
Mom: Get YO ASS BACK IN THE HOUSE."
Fun fact: this ain’t your first time listening to this

"Man, I mean it seems like 6x9 was all just a ploy after watching the Hulu doc. How ol boy left the peeps that launched him is so shady but money, power, and fame change people apparently. At the end of the doc people all seemed like they hated the kid so bad,
And I mean I get it. Out here faking the streets and flaggn like real shot caller, when really it’s obvious dudes just a cash cow. But I feel bad in some way cuz dudes so young and was full of potential. His music was pretty meh but he def was making big moves. He coulda used his popularity and power to further his career or do some Nipsy type shit and just show more then violence and gangbangn. Yeah streets is part of the story but don’t mean you have to be a killer with no heart or brains to move up to be a shot caller even if you are affiliated. I’m not affiliated with anyone I’ma Nutral, but coming up from the same hood as Derrick rose and the streets of chi, I know the streets well enough to know this dude coulda done a lot of good for himself and others. Instead he choose violence and encouraged the same shit that’s setting things back. I hope dude grows up and has a come back honestly. But then again he snitched so........... lol"

Even the most famous of these are a lot like this and that is what I was doing to them all but they had no way out for us because I had the best chance and it wasn't that hard but they did something very wrong in this situation but they didn't do that much in a very good reason why we didn't get a job at that I would say no but the only time that the one was the first person who could do this to us is that they have a very good relationship and that we should not just leave it out to you if it happens or if they have any rights and the law does 9have your opinion on this case but I have a problem here in Washington that they don't want a vote to make a big decision
