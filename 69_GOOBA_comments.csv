Ladies and Gentlemen, 6ix9ine has once again broke the internet."
Omfg  these comments 😂😂😂
"1 million views. I wonder how many of those million think this is music and how many of them are watching because they are astonished that other people think it is. As someone who grew up on rap, this is over the top in every conceivable way. I think it invented new ways in which to be over the top in fact.  It seems that it used to check a lot of boxes if you had a catchy melody, poetic lyrics, and an artist who was either good-looking or exuded some kind of relatable angst. This song and video screams “I am angry, I am hyper sexual, I am unhinged, I made myself look as weird as possible to shock you, I couldn’t be bothered to write very intricate rhymes because being a lyricist is not a hallmark of being a rapper anymore.“"
